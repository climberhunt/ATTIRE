This github repository contains the source code for the garments created as part of the ATTIRE project. 

ATTIRE is a series of workshops held in 2015 at Limerick FabLab to research wearable electronics. The main goal of the project was to design and implement a werarable garment that could be demonstrated at Design Ireland 2015 expo in November 2015. 

Part of the concept developed by the team involved arrays of RGB LEDs mapped onto a garment, and various patterns are played through the LEDS depending on the synchronisation criteria of the garment. The source code contained in this archive contains code to generate the precise layout of the LED arrays as mounted in the garment, and some test patterns to debug the arrays, and optimise wiring layouts.
